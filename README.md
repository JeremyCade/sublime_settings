# Sublime Settings and Packages

Ok, I know what your thinking...

````Are you really going to use a git repo to manage your Sublime Text install?````

**YES!**

I live in a multi-machine, multi-environment world, and quite frankly I like to have the same settings across devices and operating systems. This is the quickest and easiest way for me to do that. 

## Quick Start

### Linux

    git clone git@github.com:JeremyCade/sublime_settings.git
    cd sublime_settings.git
    mv * $HOME/.config/sublime-text-3/


## Checkout Locations

### Windows
On Windows this repository should be cloned to: 

    %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\

### Ubuntu
On Ubuntu this repository should be cloned to:

    $HOME/.config/sublime-text-3/
